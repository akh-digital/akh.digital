  title: Hey! It’s me
  desc: |
    Originally from Tallinn, Estonia, I come from a family of tech enginners (railway & industrial construction). Although I studied cross-culture communications and romance languages in Saint-Petersburg, I never worked in linguistics, but it helped me a lot in my design career. 
    In 2005, I started my first job as a graphic and packaging designer in federal wholesale company (hand and power tools for professional and household use). During my 8+ years there, I successfully created over 100 packaging and publishing projects. Then, I worked as a graphic designer in St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, creating various in- and outdoor materials, printing stuff, illustrations.
    Since 2014, I've been actively involved in an IT sphere - creating design systems, ERP systems, Web-ordering, B2C web apps, websites and digital illustrations using Figma. I successfully worked as a UI/UX designer, creating digital solutions for Siemens AG, Tassta GmbH, Alcon, Essilor, CooperVision, to name a few.
    Here, at this particular website you can find an array of my latest commercial design works - realized and launched. Enjoy staying here!
