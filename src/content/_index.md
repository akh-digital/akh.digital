Saint-Petersburg-based product designer with a career in the industry building human-centric interfaces and digital products. For me, digital products are more than just lines of code; they combine aesthetics, functionality and business objectives, with a strong focus on user needs. 

With 20 years in the game I worked with clients in a wide array of industries in Russia and around the globe.
