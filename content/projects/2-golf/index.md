Disc golf is rapidly growing in popularity, actually it is one of the fastest-growing sports in modern times, with 33% increase in games played from 2019 to 2020 alone. Recent numbers are even more impressive.

The website was planned to promote this sport in Russia like and as the easy and fast way to share most important and interesting facts with new and potential players. Creative process was rather long and with many iterations, but in the end RDGA got completely satisfied with the result: clean-looking, easy-to-use and adapted to any devices also with simple path to expand when necessary.
